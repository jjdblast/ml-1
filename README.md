machine-learning
================

Migrate some of my machine learning code from Dropbox (unavailable any longer in China) to github.
The files in this repo contains some simple algorithms I implemented along the way of learning ML, and the code might be messy, so no intention to make it a off-the-shelf toolbox for the time being, ;-)
